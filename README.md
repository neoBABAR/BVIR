Carried out as part of a integrative plant biology course in the third year of a biology degree.

The aim was to observe the influence of tonoplastic transporters on the distribution of sugars in pericarp cells of Solanum lycopersicum.
For this we asked ourselves if there were correlation between the flow of glucose and malate in the vacuoles of the pericarp.
